# Basic Machine Learning Models by Adrian

This project demonstrates foundational machine learning techniques using **scikit-learn** and a basic **autoencoder built with PyTorch**. It includes implementations of:

- Autoencoder (for dimensionality reduction)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Linear Regression
- Other Scikit-learn classifiers

## Features

- PyTorch autoencoder for feature extraction  
- Classification using scikit-learn models  
- Regression using linear models  
- Dataset preprocessing and splitting  
- Basic performance metrics

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.11  
- PyTorch 
- Scikit-learn  
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib  


## Notes

- This is a **personal study project** for practicing basic ML workflows with autoencoders and scikit-learn models.  
- Not optimized for production or deployment.  

## Use Cases

- Learning how to integrate autoencoders with ML models  
- Comparing traditional ML performance on raw vs. encoded features  
- Practicing end-to-end ML pipelines with PyTorch + scikit-learn
